            <h4>Instructions</h4>
                To use Bach Chorale Workshop, 
                    <a id="inline-link"  href="index.html">
                        navigate to the home page
                    </a> 
                and select or search for one of over 400 chorales. The first number of each chorale refers to the 
                    <a id="inline-link" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis" target="_blank">
                        BWV number
                    </a>           
                of the cantata from which it is excerpted, while the second number (for BWV 1-250) refers to the movement of 
                the cantata in which you'll find the chorale. 
                <br>
                <br>
                After loading, you will see a score of the piece to the right and the sound controls to the left. Using the 
                sliding bars, you can go to any second in the music and set the tempo anywhere between 50 and 200 bpm. There are 
                also separate instrument and volume controls for each voice of the chorale.
                <br>
                <br>
                For more of a challenge, toggle the practice mode button at the top. This will hide the score and limit your
                volume-changing abilities so that you can only change the volume of the soprano/alto parts or tenor/bass parts
                at the same time. You can still set separate instruments for each voice. Please note that <span style="background-color: lightyellow">
                highlighted chorales</span> are not available in practice mode at this time.

            <h4>Project Background</h4>
                This project was designed to enable ear training students to have richer opportunities to practice hearing multiple
                voices at once. Previously, students had to choose between taking dictation of chorales from commercial recordings
                (where the acoustic circumstances and blending made the prospect of transcribing all four voices a very advanced task
                indeed) or having a friend or teacher play the chorales on the piano (where it is nearly impossible to distinguish
                crossing inner voices). While the Bach chorales have long been available in MIDI format, manipulating the timbre and
                balance of each voice was a labor intensive process and put many steps between the student and the exercise that would
                be most helpful to them. It is our hope that this site fills the gap in the process and can enable students to work up
                to transcribing all four voices of a chorale.

            <h4>Code</h4>
                This site hosted on GitHub Pages. Using a static collection of Bach chorales in MIDI and MUSICXML format and 
                libraries that convert music events into data types that can be interpreted and adjsuted by your web browser's 
                audio context, we created this simple player. Please visit
